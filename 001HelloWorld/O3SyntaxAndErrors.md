# Syntax and Errors

- syntax: rules we need to follow for code to run properly
- case sensitivity
- semicolon: all statements need to end with a semicolon
- double quotes: text between double quotes is a string
- when we break the rules, we get errors:

```c
script.c: In function ‘main’:
script.c:6:1: error: expected ‘;’ before ‘}’ token
 }
 ````
- component location: In function 'main'
- line and column number: 6:1
- description: expected ‘;’ before ‘}’
