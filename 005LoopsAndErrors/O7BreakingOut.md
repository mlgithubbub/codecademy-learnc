# Breaking Out

- The keyword **break** allows us to break out of a loop and stop it from running any more times
- **break** can often be avoided with careful planning of the conditional controlling the loop
- can result in unexpected processing when a programmer has a mental plan centered around a loop finishing all its iterations
- when used effectively can increase the efficiency of a program and minimize memory use through unnecessary variables
- most often used when program wants to run an infinite loop in a controlled manner, for example a program that runs until the user types "quit"
