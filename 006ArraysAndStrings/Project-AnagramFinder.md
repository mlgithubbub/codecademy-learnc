# Anagram Finder

- Write a program to determine whether two string are anagrams or not, i.e. same letters: "code" and "deco"
- Each string will only contain the lower-case letters a, b, c, d
- Create two strings and two counter arrays: the counter arrays count the occurences of each letter with index 0 being letter a, index 1 being letter b, etc.
- Ignore spaces
- If the letter counts are the same, the strings are anagrams
