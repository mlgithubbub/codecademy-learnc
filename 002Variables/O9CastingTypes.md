# Casting Types

## Implicit conversion:
- when you set one variable equal to another variable of a different type, the compiler will try to convert them
```c
int a;
double b = 3.0;
a = b;
```

## Explicit conversion:
- tell the compiler what type you want to set a variable to with casting
```c
int a;
double b = 3.0;
a = (int)b;
