# Updating Values

- variables can also be set at any future point in the code
```c
int total_units;
…
…
…
total_units = 3;
````
- you only have to reference the type once (in the initial declaration)

- you can also set a variable *a* to be the same as the value of another variable *b*, but if you change *b* later, the values of the variables will no longer be the same
